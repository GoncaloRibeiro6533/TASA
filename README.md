  <br>TASA - Theater Auto Silence App<br>
</h1>

&nbsp;

<h4 align="center">Mobile app that silences your phone based on location or scheduled events.</h4>
<space></space>
TASA ‚Äì Theater Auto Silence App is an Android mobile application developed to manage automatic silencing of the device based on user-defined conditions such as geographic location or scheduled calendar events.

The application triggers silencing based on predefined rules, either when the user enters specific locations or during scheduled events such as meetings, lectures, or cultural activities.

## Functionalities

### User Authentication
- User login and registration.

### üìç Location-Based Automation
- Create geofenced zones (e.g., home, school, gym).
- Automatically triggers DND mode when the user enters the location.

### üõë Do Not Disturb Management
- Mutes the device when entering a geofence.
- Automatically restores sound when exiting.

### üß† Activity Recognition
- Detects if the user is walking, biking, or driving using Google‚Äôs Activity API.

### üåê Rule Management
- Add, update, or delete rules for geofences.
- Manage geofence radius, location name, and time ranges.


## ‚öôÔ∏è Background Execution

Tasa aims for low-power execution:

- The app **does not run continuously in the background**.
- It is only activated by the **Geofencing API** when a transition is detected.
- On **entry**, it starts a **foreground service** to monitor real-time location.
- On **exit**, it **stops the foreground service**, conserving resources.
- If location is disabled or permissions are missing, Tasa notifies the user appropriately.

---

> ‚ö†Ô∏è The app notifies the user when location is off and rules may not be applied.
